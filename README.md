# RSA_Algorithm
The RSA Algorithm is a Asymmetric cryptographic algortihm. It is the most secure way of encrypting, decrypting and signing the files and text messages. It actually works on two different keys which are private and public key. For Encryption we use privatekey to encrypt the date and for the signing the data we use public key and verify the integrity by using the privatekey.
